## **💡 Innovation & Creativity**  

### 🔹 **AI-Powered Predictions**  
Unlike traditional disaster alert systems that rely solely on pre-set thresholds, this system **dynamically analyzes multiple factors** (e.g., earthquake magnitude, river levels, wind speed) to **predict disaster risks** before they escalate.  

### 🔹 **Smart Alerts & Early Warnings**  
- **Real-time ML predictions** notify users before a disaster strikes  
- **Location-based alerts** using reverse geocoding (OpenCage API)  
- **SMS emergency notifications** even when internet access is unavailable  

### 🔹 **Interactive & Intuitive Dashboard**  
The **web interface** visualizes disaster-prone areas with:  
- **Risk level indicators** (color-coded for low, medium, and high risk)  
- **Live disaster location tracking** using **Leaflet.js / Google Maps API**  
- **Dynamic updates** as new data arrives
